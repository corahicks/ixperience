        Hi everyone! My name is A’Cora, and I am a rising sophomore at Amherst
        College in Massachusetts. One of my most interesting facts is that I am
        a fraternal twin, but many people see my sister and me as identical
        because we look pretty similar. If you know us both well, telling us
        apart becomes easy, as my friends have told me. Besides having a twin, I
        have two younger brothers, two younger sisters, and a golden retriever
        named Harvey. My GitHub is: corahicks.

        Some of my hobbies include dancing: I won my middle school talent show
        twice in a row (lol), but I am also on my college dance and step team. I
        am no professional; I just have rhythm :)!

        Poetry is another hobby of mine. When I was in first grade, I wanted to
        be an author. I would write fiction stories, and then later, I was
        introduced to poetry in the third grade. For a while, I stopped pursuing
        that dream of mine until I came on campus. Amherst came me the space to
        take my poetry seriously. Last semester, I took a poetry class to hone
        my writing skills (since my high school didn’t offer poetry courses),
        and I am involved in my school’s oldest literary magazine, "The
        Indicator.” I published three poems in the magazine :)

        Photography is another passion I developed in middle school. I learned
        studio and event photography throughout high school, but my favorite is
        event photography. Many events I photographed were for community events
        and small businesses, which I enjoyed because I love capturing memories.
        People can look back at the memories, telling a story of thousands of
        words with one click of the camera. Event photography is one of my
        favorite methods of giving back to my community.
